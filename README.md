## Description

A dashboard that display meter level electric energy consumption for the short term (10 days ahead). 

Using json dataset that represents meter level forecasts and actual energy readings for 15 meters, this application allows users to plot time vs forecast and actual energy reading by a selected zone or all combined. 

Finally, users will be able to gain a big picture understanding of the energy reading by actual energy consumption in one place.
